# Tenzies
Tenzi is a fast-paced dice game where players race to be the first to roll all ten of their dice to show the same number. It's a game of speed and luck, requiring players to quickly re-roll dice until they get a matching set.

This version is a React-based web application version, in which users can roll dice and "freeze" dice until they hit the same number for all dice.

*Note: This was a project built by me while following the "Learn React" Scrimba certification course, in which the course provided the design and concept*
